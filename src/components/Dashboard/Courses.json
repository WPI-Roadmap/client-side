Sensor configuration is the optimal choice of sensor parameters including placement and selection. To this end, the optimization of information metrics such as conditional entropy, Fisher information, and mutual information will be discussed. The topics of estimation and data fusion will address the computation of a state from a sequence of measurements from multiple sensors. To this end, techniques such as the Kalman filter, extended- and unscented Kalman filter, and particle filter will be discussed. Topics on multi-sensor data association, such as the multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) filter will be discussed. Finally, topics on distributed and decentralized estimation and fusion will be discussed. Recommended background: Fluency with linear algebra (MA 2051 or similar), ordinary differential equations (MA 2071 or similar), and introductory control theory (AE 2310 / 3713, ES 3011, ECE 3012, or similar) is required. Fluency with either MATLAB or Python is required. An undergraduate-level familiarity with inertial navigation and optimal estimation (AE 3310 or similar) is required.

Most of the classroom time will be spent working individually or in groups, first learning the language, and then programming simulation projects. We will also discuss several papers on biological simulations from the primary scientific literature. In constructing and comparing their simulations, students will demonstrate for themselves how relatively simple behavioral rules followed by individual molecules, cells, or organisms can result in complex system behaviors.\u003cbr /\u003eRecommended background: Students taking this course must have a solid background in a biological area they would like to simulate, at about the depth provided by a BB 3000 level class.

II\u003cbr /\u003eComputer simulations are becoming increasingly important in understanding and predicting the behavior of a wide variety of biological systems, ranging from metastasis of cancer cells, to spread of disease in an epidemic, to management of natural resources such as fisheries and forests. In this course, students will learn to use a graphical programming language to simulate biological systems. Most of the classroom time will be spent working individually or in groups, first learning the language, and then programming simulation projects. We will also discuss several papers on biological simulations from the primary scientific literature. In constructing and comparing their simulations, students will demonstrate for themselves how relatively simple behavioral rules followed by individual molecules, cells, or organisms can result in complex system behaviors.\u003cbr /\u003eRecommended background: Students taking this course must have a solid background in a biological area they would like to simulate, at about the depth provided by a BB 3000 level class.

IThis beginning course provides important background for all science and engineering disciplines regarding the capabilities and limitations of materials relevant to the development of medical devices. Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structureproperty-processing relationships in biomaterials, specifically metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials. In particular, this course investigates connections between structure and mechanical properties, and how working and thermal treatments may transform structure and thus alter material properties. This knowledge is then applied to material selection decisions for the design of medical devices and engineered tissues.Recommended background: prior knowledge of college-level chemistry and physics.Students who have previously received credit for ES 2001 or BME 2811 may not receive credit for BME 2001.\u003c/p\u003e",

Extensive research efforts have been expended on understanding how biologic systems interact with biomaterials. Meanwhile, controversy has revolved around biomaterials and their availability as a result of the backlash to the huge liability resulting from controversies related to material and processing shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically addresses the unique role of biomaterials in medical device design and the use of emerging biomaterials technology in medical devices. The need to understand design requirements of medical devices based on safety and efficacy will be addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if testing fails to account for synergistic interactions from chronic loading, aqueous environments, and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies are readily available to assess accelerated effects of loading in physiologic-like environments. This combined with subchronic effects of animal implants is a potential tool in assessing durability. It is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total biologic environment. The ultimate determination of safety comes not only from following the details of regulations, but with an understanding of potential failure modes and designs that lowers the risk of these failures. This course will evaluate biomaterials and their properties as related to the design and reliability of medical devices.\u003c/p\u003e",

While quantitative business data is increasingly available, qualitative data is often the source of the deeper understanding needed for exploring, explaining, and developing theories for complex socio-technical business environments that dominate our digital economy. This course focuses on methods for collecting and analyzing qualitative research data with the purpose of enabling students to make the novel discoveries that characterize PhD research in business. Students will become familiar with methods for collecting (e.g., interviews and focus groups) and analyzing (e.g., coding techniques and case study analysis methods), as well as the software packages that aid in qualitative data organization and analyses. They will understand which collection, coding, and analysis techniques to use in which situations, how to interpret results, and how data collection and analysis methods affect research results. These skills are critical for understanding how business can contribute to solving the large, societal problems within and across disciplines and industries.

This course introduces students to the practice of negotiation and mediation in the context of design and construction. Learning from general theories of negotiation and conflict resolution, students will consider the role of Construction Managers as mediators and consensus-builders who must reconcile conflicting visions about how a specific project should be designed and developed. The course examines a variety of contexts and problems that create a need for negotiation, and raise questions about what it means to negotiate well. It examines how negotiators manage their interactions and ask, \u0026#34;Why do we get one deal rather than another?\u0026#34; The course reviews how negotiators create opportunities for mutual gains, how they construct relationships in which trust is possible, and to how they build sympathy in their interactions. The course also examines the ways in which expanding issues, adding parties, negotiating at multiple levels, and acting in a community context influence negotiation practice. It concludes by understanding how a third neutral party (mediator) could help in managing and solving conflicts.\u003c/p\u003e",

Unlike conventional chemically synthesized drugs, that are easily identified and characterized, biologics are variable in nature, more structurally complex and more difficult to define and characterize. Consequently, development of biologics as therapeutic agents, can be far more challenging. Moreover, the development of generic versions known as “biosimilars” pose even greater issues over their drug counterparts. While generic drugs are approved on the basis of chemical and bioequivalence, biosimilars require a different less well-defined standard of “sameness.” This course seeks to unravel the complexities surrounding biologics and biosimilars and keep pace with the ever changing scientific and legislative landscape. Prerequisite Courses: This course provides a logical extension of material covered in CH555 Special Topics “Drug Regulations.”\u003c/p\u003e",

This class adopts a unified approach to transport phenomena, providing the fundamental background required for analysis ofcomplex problems. Students will use mathematical techniques for analytic and approximate solutions such as: separation of variables, similarity solutions, perturbation theory, and Laplace and Fourier transform methods. Methods involvingnon-dimensionalization and scaling will be emphasized. Special problems to be covered may include the lubrication approximation, creeping flow, and potential and laminar boundary-layer flows, as well as heat and mass transport in multicomponent systems. Students are expected to have taken previous courses on transport processesand have mathematical background that includes solution of differential equations.\u003c/p\u003e",

Machine organization topics include the Von Neumann model of execution, functional organization of computer hardware, the memory hierarchy, caching performance, and pipelining. Assembly language topics include representations of numbers in computers, basic instruction sets, addressing modes, stacks and procedures, low-level I/O, and the functions of compilers, assemblers, linkers, and loaders. The course also presents how code and data structures of higher-level languages are mapped into the assembly language and machine representations of a modern processor. Programming projects will be carried out in the C language and the assembly language of a modern processor.\u003cbr /\u003eRecommended background: CS 2301 or CS 2303, or a significant knowledge of C/C\u0026#43;\u0026#43;.\u003c/p\u003e",

The first part of the lecture focuses on public key algorithms, in particular ElGamal, elliptic curves and Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The underlying theory of Galois fields will be introduced. Implementation of performance security aspects of the algorithms will be looked at. The second part of the course deals with advanced protocols. New schemes for authentication, identification and zero-knowledge proof will be introduced. Some complex protocols for real-world application— such as key distribution in networks and for smart cards—will be introduced and analyzed. The third part will look into state-of-the-art cryptoanalysis (i.e., ways to break cryptosystems). Brute force attacks based on special purpose machines, the baby-step giantstep and the Pohlig-Hellman algorithms will be discussed.

Numerous applications are presented to motivate coverage of fundamental operating principles of circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors; model the signals produced by these sensors; and analyze the circuits and systems used to amplify and process these signals. After a review of Kirchhoff ‘s current and voltage laws, fundamental analysis techniques such as Thevenin and Norton’s theorems and the superposition principle are used to model and analyze sensors, circuits, and systems. Concepts from analysis of linear, time-invariant continuous-time signals and systems are introduced as necessary, including Fourier series and characterization of systems such as filters in both the frequency domain (bandwidth, transfer function) and time domain (rise time, step response).

This course explores these foundations by using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented.

Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment. Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential circuits, and synchronous state machines. Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test, and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs.\u003cbr /\u003eRecommended background: Introductory Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts covered in a course such as ECE 2010 or RBE 1001, and MA 1022.

I\u003cbr /\u003eThe object of this course is a comprehensive treatment of electromagnetic engineering principles covering the entire application spectrum from static to dynamic field phenomena. The starting point will be the basic electric and magnetic field definitions of Coulomb and Biot-Savart leading to Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws. They form the foundation of electro- and magnetostatics fields. Students will examine capacitive and inductive systems and relate them to lumped element circuit models. By introducing temporal and spatial magnetic flux variations, Faraday’s law is established. The engineering implications of this law are investigated in terms of transformer and motor actions. Incorporation of the displacement current density into Ampere’s law and combining it with Faraday’s law will then culminate in the complete set of Maxwell’s field equations. As a result of these equations, students will develop the concept of wave propagation in the time and frequency domain with practical applications such as wireless communication, radar, Global Positioning Systems, and microwave circuits.\u003cbr /\u003eRecommended background: ECE 2019.\u003c/p\u003e",

The emphasis is on top-down design starting with high level models using a hardware description language (such as VHDL or Verilog) as a tool for the design, synthesis, modeling, test bench development, and testing and verification of complete digital systems. These types of systems include the use of embedded soft core processors as well as lower level modules created from custom logic or imported IP blocks. Interfaces will be developed to access devices external to the FPGA such as memory or peripheral communication devices. The integration of tools and design methodologies will be addressed through a discussion of system on a chip (SOC) integration, methodologies, design for performance, and design for test. Topics: Hardware description languages, system modeling, synthesis, simulation and testing of digital circuits; Design integration to achieve specific system design goals including architecture, planning and integration, and testing; Use of soft core and IP modules to meet specific architecture and design goals.

      "Course_Description": "\u003cp\u003eThe availability of electric power in a variety of forms is integral to modern society. Very often, electric power must be converted from one form to another to meet a specific application need – this conversion process is accomplished through the use and efficient management of power electronics. Design of power electronics is introduced first by examining the performance characteristics of basic switching devices, which enable critical management functions that include pulse width modulation (PWM) and output power regulation. Half and full-wave AC source rectification and techniques for improving the resulting DC power characteristics are covered, including polyphase AC sources. AC voltage control with applications for induction motors is studied. DC-DC power conversion is examined, covering a variety of circuit architectures, with applications in feedback control. DC to AC power inversion and resulting power quality considerations are explored. The impacts of design decisions on power electronics systems, from micro- to megawatts, are demonstrated through numerical simulation. This course includes guest lectures, project work including case-studies and selected power system demonstrations.

      "Course_Description": "The ability to see the simplicity in a complex design problem is a skill that is not usually taught in engineering classes. Some engineers, when faced with design problems, immediately fill up pages and pages of calculations, or do complex circuit simulations or finite-element analyses. One problem with this approach is that if you get an answer, you do not know if it is correct unless you have an intuitive “feel” for what the answer should be. The application of some simple rules of thumb and design techniques is a possible first step to developing intuition into the behavior of complex electrical systems. This course outlines some ways of thinking about analog circuits and systems that are intended will help to develop intuition and guide design. The lectures are a mixture of instructional sessions covering new background material, and design case studies.\nPrerequisites: Undergraduate background in device physics, microelectronics, control systems, electromagnetism.",

An overview of bipolar and CMOS fabrication processes shows the differences between discrete and integrated circuit design. The bipolar and MOS transistors are reviewed with basic device physics and the development of circuit models in various operating regions. The use of SPICE simulation in the design process will be covered. Integrated amplifier circuits are developed with an emphasis on understanding performance advantages and limitation in such areas as speed, noise and power dissipation. Simple circuits are combined to form the basic functional building blocks such as the op-amp, comparator, voltage reference, etc. These circuit principles will be explored in an IC design project, which may be fabricated in a commercial analog process. Examples of possible topics include sample-and-hold (S/H) amplifier, analogto-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters, phase-locked loop (PLL), voltagecontrolled oscillator, phase detector, switched capacitor and continuous-time filters, and sampled current techniques.\u003cbr /\u003ePrerequisite: Background in analog circuits both at the transistor and functional block [op-amp, comparator, etc.] level.

Students will learn in detail the principles of traditional reactive power compensation (shunt reactors and capacitors); series compensation and modern static reactive compensation like SVC, STATCOM and other Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices. The effects of each of these types of compensation on static and dynamic voltage control, reactive power requirement and steady-state and transient stability problems are covered from theoretical as well as practical aspects. Particular attention is given to the mathematical models and principles of operation of many types of compensation systems. Basic principles of operation and control of High-Voltage DC (HVDC) systems and their impact on steady-state and dynamics of power system will be covered as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrerequisite: ECE 5500 Power System Analysis.\u003c/p\u003e",

Traditional economic analysis using naturally occurring data is often confounded by the complexities of the real world. Economic experiments, on the other hand, give researchers the control required for isolating behaviors of interest. As such, economic experiments can be useful tools for testing existing theories and establishing empirical regularities assisting in the development of new theories. In this course, we cover the basic principles of experimental design. We also study a number of classic experiments, on topics ranging from the efficiency of markets to decision-making under uncertainty and behavioral game theory. Students will participate in mock experiments and will begin putting their new skills into practice by designing their own experiments, which may serve as the basis for IQPs/MQPs. If time permits, we will discuss some of the basic methods for analyzing experimental data, which presents challenges somewhat different from naturally occurring data due to small sample sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecommended Background: ECON 1110 This course will be offered in 2019-20, and in alternating years thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e",

While the course will focus on short and feature film screenplays, the knowledge can also apply to other screenwriting forms such as documentaries and web series.

This course offers a deep exploration of the vibrancy of Black American life and thought through the lens of African American literature. Students will actively and critically read selected African American texts considering the historical contexts in which they were produced as well as analyzing their formal elements. While the course will focus on Black American experience in the United States, it will do so in dialogue with the larger diasporic Black experience. The topics will rotate regularly, alternating between close examination of different authors, genres, themes, or movements while preparing students for the HUA capstone experience. Examples of authors are Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Lorraine Hansberry and August Wilson. Examples of genres are slave narratives, sermons, autobiographies, dramas, spirituals, blues, and drama. Examples of themes are race and the law, freedom struggles, and intersections between race and class, gender, and sexuality. Examples of movements are the Black Arts Movement, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Black Lives Matter Movement. Faculty offering the course will indicate which authors, genres or themes they intend to present on the HUA website well before student signups. This course may be repeated for different topics.

Thus, institutions have emerged at the international and transnational levels to coordinate collective problem solving. But governance involves more than just the practicality of problem solving; it also involves uncertainty, controversy, power and politics. This course will examine the ways in which global environmental governance has been conceived: from establishing international institutions and agreements, to less tangible ways of interacting. We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations to communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates. Students will then use this conceptual and theoretical basis to analyze major global environmental issues including: deforestation; biodiversity; endangered species; and climate change. The goals of this course are to gain an understanding of the main positions in global environmental debates; critically analyze these positions; and gain insight into the politics of global environmental policy and governance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e  Recommended Background: None, but ENV1100 would be helpful.\u003c/p\u003e",

Social media can enable local actors to link with others from across the globe to incite social and environmental change. Social media has enabled people to document and share injustices (e.g., violence; dumping of toxic waste) in places where freedom of the press is limited or non-existent, and it has enabled people across different social groups (race, class, etc.) to engage with one another on issues of shared concern. Social media has also allowed people to share resources (financial, expertise, and organizational) with other social actors across the globe, empowering communities in novel ways. This course introduces students to the phenomena of social and environmental movements, theories on why they succeed and fail, and how social media has changed the landscape of social mobilization. This course will draw on interdisciplinary readings, concepts, and case studies from the social sciences, with emphasis on geography, public policy, sociology, and media studies. Course work will include small group projects, analyses of current social movement cases, and a final project. The final project will consist of interviewing members of a current social movement (potentially using social media), evaluating whether particular social media applications have helped to enable social mobilization, and designing new or revised social media tools to further enhance social mobilization.

II\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis course examines the limitations of traditional economic models and charts a new course for current policies and practices. To chart this path we draw upon and synthesize examples from existing alternative economies (e.g., different forms of dematerialization, hybrid organizations, solidary economy, sharing economy).The course critically examines current paradigms of greening and seeks to expand thinking that will encompass new, alternative, and socially just conceptions of economy and economic development. A particular emphasis is laid on the spatial implications of de-growth oriented activities which partly challenge existing models and research methods in economic geography.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuggested background: Basic knowledge of economics and environmental governance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis course will be offered in 2019-20, and in alternating years thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e",

The Systems\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThinking analysis accounts for feedback and resistance to change often exhibited by real world\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003esystems. In this course, students will study system identification and delineation, causal loops\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eand feedback diagrams, stock-and-flow diagrams, system leverage points, delays and\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eoscillations, mental models and unintended consequences, and behavior patterns; and use these\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003econcepts to improve the performance of engineering, business, and complex social systems. The\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ecourse will explore great system failures, how they might have been avoided, and how we can\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003elearn from them.

This introductory project-based course introduces students to the world of digital fabrication and provides hands-on experience on maker technology (3D Printing, laser cutting, vacuum forming, electronics, Arduino programming and more), design thinking, value creation, and the basics of engineering design.  Students develop their own creative and artistic inventions, prototype, test, learn, get feedback, and experiment again through fun activities and methods to spark discovery.  The course culminates in a team project that uses a human-centered design thinking and value creation approaches to develop a solution to a real-world problem and fabricate a product.  Students demo their prototype and pitch their value proposition at Prototype Day Showcase to test and get feedback on it as they compete for the “Maker Goat of the Term” award.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecommended background: \u003cspan\u003e Computer-Aided Design (ES1310)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis course satisfies a 2000 level engineering science requirement for ME, RBE, ECE, Business majors and a free elective requirement for all other majors.\u003c/p\u003e",

Work with language supports interpretations of short texts (written, viewed, and heard), small-group interactions that navigate real-life situations, and presentations on key cultural products of the German-speaking world.

Thus, institutions have emerged at the international and transnational levels to coordinate collective problem solving. But governance involves more than just the practicality of problem solving; it also involves uncertainty, controversy, power and politics. This course will examine the ways in which global environmental governance has been conceived: from establishing international institutions and agreements, to less tangible ways of interacting. We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations to communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates. Students will then use this conceptual and theoretical basis to analyze major global environmental issues including: deforestation; biodiversity; endangered species; and climate change. The goals of this course are to gain an understanding of the main positions in global environmental debates; critically analyze these positions; and gain insight into the politics of global environmental policy and governance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e  Recommended Background: None, but ENV1100 would be helpful.\u003c/p\u003e",

In this class we will explore the popular cultures of East Asia to better understand the influences that have shaped the region’s contemporary societies. Focus country will be either Japan or China, depending on term offered. Students will study various media of popular culture, such as films, songs, advertisements, video games, manga, anime, to explore the changing society of these countries. We will link the individual cultural phenomena studied to both internal and external influences, situating popular culture within transnational currents and exchanges when appropriate. No prior knowledge of Asian history is required for this class.

It emphasizes CNC (computer-controlled)machining. Students will learn how to go from a solid (CAD, computer-aideddesign) model to a machined part, using CAM software (computer-aidedmanufacturing) and CNC machining. They will also be exposed to associatedissues in manufacturing process analysis, engineering design, material science,and in dimensional and surface metrology. Using machining as an example, thescience of manufacturing processes is developed in a combination of class workand laboratory experience. The laboratory experience includes an experimentalcomponent that relates process variables in machining with performance andmachined part quality. Students whose project work will necessitate fabricationof parts and those who want a background in manufacturing process science andengineering should take this course.\u003c/p\u003e",

Explicit solutions for dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, both damped and undamped, is derived for free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and forced vibration caused by different excitations. Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration response of both multi-degreeof-freedom (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with distributed parameters. As the basis of modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained in advance by solving an associated generalized eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties of the vibration modes with respect to the stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved. Computational methods for vibration analysis are introduced. Applications include but are not limited to cushion design of falling packages, vehicles traveling on a rough surface, multi-story building subjected to seismic and wind loading, and vibration analysis of bridges subjected to traffic loading.

These challenges are compounded by multidisciplinary applications to be developed inexpensively in short time while satisfying stringent design objectives. As a consequence, effective quantitative engineering methodologies, such as optical techniques, are frequently used in the study and optimization of advanced components and systems. In this course, modern laser metrology techniques are discussed and their practical applications to solve problems, with emphasis on nondestructive testing (NDT), are illustrated with laboratory demonstrations. Topics covered include wave and Fourier optics, classic and holographic interferometry, speckle techniques, solid-state lasers, fiber optics, CCD cameras, computer vision, camera calibration methods, and image processing and data reduction algorithms as required in quantitative fringe analysis. Detail examples of nondestructive testing and coherent optical metrology in solid mechanics, vibrations, heat transfer, electromagnetics, and reverse engineering are given. Students are required to work on projects depending on their background and interests. Recommended background: mechanics, materials, physics, knowledge of a high-level computer programming language.

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science. Students cannot receive credit for this course if they have received credit for ME 5371/MTE 5843/MFE 5843 Fundamentals of Surface Metrology or the Special Topics (ME 593/MTE 594/MFE 594) version of Fundamentals of Surface Metrology.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The focus of this course is on direct metal AM processes that are used in aerospace, automobile, medical, and energy industries. The objective of the course is to enable students to understand the working principles of various additive manufacturing processes, assess the suitability of metal AM processes for different designs and applications, apply process design concepts to metal AM processes via analytical and finite element modeling approaches, and have an introductory-level understanding of design for AM. Through the course project, students will have the opportunity to experience hands-on design, manufacturing, and characterization of additively manufactured materials, and will work in an interdisciplinary team of mechanical, materials, and manufacturing engineers. The economics of the manufacturing process will also be addressed, with an emphasis on determining the major cost drivers and discussing cost minimization strategies.

Applications of axiomatic design are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is a design methodology based on the premise that there are two axioms that apply to all good designs. These axioms facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Manufacturing process analysis is considered from the perspective of supporting design. Methods of analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are sought. Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces. The ability to find commonalities across applications and generalize is emphasized to facilitate further development of principles with broad applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. Homework and quizzes are given and delivered online. There is a project to design a manufacturing process. The topics can be from work or dissertations that can be interpreted as manufacturing processes and tools.

The focus of this course is on direct metal AM processes that are used in aerospace, automobile, medical, and energy industries. The objective of the course is to enable students to understand the working principles of various additive manufacturing processes, assess the suitability of metal AM processes for different designs and applications, apply process design concepts to metal AM processes via analytical and finite element modeling approaches, and have an introductory-level understanding of design for AM. Through the course project, students will have the opportunity to experience hands-on design, manufacturing, and characterization of additively manufactured materials, and will work in an interdisciplinary team of mechanical, materials, and manufacturing engineers. The economics of the manufacturing process will also be addressed, with an emphasis on determining the major cost drivers and discussing cost minimization strategies.

Applications of axiomatic design are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is a design methodology based on the premise that there are two axioms that apply to all good designs. These axioms facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Manufacturing process analysis is considered from the perspective of supporting design. Methods of analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are sought. Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces. The ability to find commonalities across applications and generalize is emphasized to facilitate further development of principles with broad applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. Homework and quizzes are given and delivered online. There is a project to design a manufacturing process. The topics can be from work or dissertations that can be interpreted as manufacturing processes and tools.

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science.

The objective of the course is to enable students to understand the working principles of various additive manufacturing processes, assess the suitability of metal AM processes for different designs and applications, apply process design concepts to metal AM processes via analytical and finite element modeling approaches, and have an introductory-level understanding of design for AM. Through the course project, students will have the opportunity to experience hands-on design, manufacturing, and characterization of additively manufactured materials, and will work in an interdisciplinary team of mechanical, materials, and manufacturing engineers. The economics of the manufacturing process will also be addressed, with an emphasis on determining the major cost drivers and discussing cost minimization strategies.

      "Course_Description": "\u003cp\u003e(2 credits) The course starts with an in-depth study of axiomatic design. Applications of axiomatic design are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is a design methodology based on the premise that there are two axioms that apply to all good designs. These axioms facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Manufacturing process analysis is considered from the perspective of supporting design. Methods of analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are sought. Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces. The ability to find commonalities across applications and generalize is emphasized to facilitate further development of principles with broad applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. Homework and quizzes are given and delivered online. There is a project to design a manufacturing process. The topics can be from work or dissertations that can be interpreted as manufacturing processes and tools. Credit cannot be given for this course and any of the similar, in-class versions for 3 credits, MFE 520, MTE 520 and ME 543.\u003c/p\u003e",

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science.

      "Course_Description": "\u003cp\u003eSurface engineering (SE) is an old discipline or technology but is nowadays more relevant than ever. The societal trends toward “sustainability” necessitate more advanced and durable materials with a lower carbon footprint. Surface engineering is the key technology that can “up-engineer” a cheap readily available material into a high-end performance material with a long lifetime. The \u003ci\u003eengineering\u003c/i\u003e is applied where it matters – at the \u003ci\u003esurface\u003c/i\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis course will introduce the full palette of Advanced Surface Engineering methods that can be applied to mainly metallic materials, albeit the nature of the materials solutions applied are multidisciplinary when it comes to materials systems. The overall purpose of applying SE is to change the surface properties for enhancing materials performance. This is obviously relevant in a plethora of different applications in many different fields. The course will address conversion- and (electro-)chemical methods, physical and chemical gas-phase deposition methods, thermochemical (diffusion) methods, mechanical and thermal methods, and spray coatings. This overall classification includes such processes as anodizing, electroplating, chemical deposition, sol-gel, CVD and PVD, carburizing, nitriding, special (new) diffusion processes, induction- and laser hardening, shot peening and thermal spray (non-exhaustive list). The course will emphasize that SE is not “one-size-fits all’ and that the technologies have to be applied prudently and in close interplay with the substrate materials involved. Examples of SE in industrial applications will be showcased throughout the course. The course also actively engages students in “designing” SE solutions for different real-life industrial cases.\u003c/p\u003e",

How can I make a larger work out of smaller parts? How can I vary statements to create interest without compromising coherence? Where do I start? A progressive series of composition projects will build techniques in relevant areas including rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Exercises in mechanics will be complemented by contemplation and discussion of artistic, aesthetic and philosophical ideas that are equally important in the compositional process. We will examine the relationship between musical works and how they are communicated as instructions to others (e.g. orally, as symbols, prose, graphic images, or computer programs). Weekly listening, reading, and composition assignments draw on a broad range of musical styles and intellectual traditions from various cultures and historical periods.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRecommended background: understanding of basic music theory through coursework (e.g. MU 1511, Introduction to Music or MU 1611, Fundamentals of Music) or equivalent experience.\u003c/p\u003e",

Within the organization, scarce resources (including financial, human, and technological) need to be allocated and aligned with strategic goals. External to the organization, consideration is given to sustainability and environmentally responsible use of resources. This course focuses on process analysis, engineering design thinking and process implementation within the constraints of stakeholder networks. Professional engineering ethics and the consequences of management decision making are discussed in detail. The course includes a process analysis project and a one-piece-flow hands on laboratory experience.

The project is normally conducted in teams of two to four students. Students are encouraged to select projects with practical significance to their current and future professional responsibilities. The projects are administered, advised, and evaluated by WPI faculty as part of the learning experience, but students are also encouraged to seek mentorship from experienced colleagues in the Robotics Engineering profession. The project will include substantial analysis and/or design and conclude with a written report and a public presentation. (Prerequisites: Since the Capstone Project will draw on knowledge obtained throughout the degree program, it is expected that students will have completed most or all of the coursework within their plan of study before undertaking the capstone project.)\u003c/p\u003e",

What are the philosophical and religious foundations of the categorizations of beings operative in our contemporary cultures? How do attributions of same and different, normal and abnormal, rational and irrational, human and nonhuman shape social and political processes of inclusion and exclusion? Are social categories real, constructed, or both? This course focuses primarily on intersectional approaches to oppression and identity that see social categories such as gender, race, and class as mutually constitutive rather than separable. Course readings span a range of philosophical and religious traditions including Continental philosophy, analytic philosophy, Latina/o studies, feminist theory, queer theory, critical race theory, disability studies, and environmental studies. Students may not earn credit for both PY 2716 and RE 2716.\u003cbr /\u003eThis course will be offered in 2021-22, and in alternating years thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e",

This course is intended to answer the why, what and how of MBSE. The course provides background and motivation for transitioning to MBSE from a document centric approach to systems engineering. The course provides a foundation for MBSE by first introducing SysML as a descriptive language for modeling systems in terms of their requirements, structure, behavior, and parametric constraints. The course then introduces the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) as a method for applying SysML to support the specification, architecture design, analysis, and verification of complex systems.

Students will learn to evaluate writing for stylistic problems and will learn revision strategies for addressing those problems. The ultimate goal of the course is to help students write sentences and paragraphs that are clear, concise, and graceful. In the first part of the course, students will review parts of speech, basic sentence types, and sentence and paragraph structure in order to understand how sentences are put together and the impact their construction has on readers. Then, through hands-on writing exercises and extensive revision of their own and others’ writing, students will learn strategies for tightening their prose (concision), achieving “flow” (cohesion and coherence) and improving usage (language specificity and precision).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecommended background: Basic knowledge of rhetorical writing (e.g., WR 1010, Elements of Writing, WR 1011, Writing About Science \u0026amp; Technology, or WR 1020, Introduction to Rhetoric.\u003c/p\u003e",

While the course will focus on short and feature film screenplays, the knowledge can also apply to other screenwriting forms such as documentaries and web series.
